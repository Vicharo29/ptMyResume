    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am a dedicated person willing to accomplish tasks with passion.
        I am interested in both hardware and software development.
        As for hardware, I have experiences in machine design using CAD,
        manufacture using 3D printers and 3D modeling machine, system development
        such as for robots. As for software, I have experiences in robot control
        using C++ with microcontrollers, GUI development using python with Qt framework,
        data processing and analysis using MATLAB. I believe these skills
        are crucial for creating cutting-edge devices to support the future.
        Besides these skills, I am also interested in PCB design, embedded system development,
        and FPGA design.
